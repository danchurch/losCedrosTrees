To our Colleagues at MDPI Forests,

We present to you our manuscript entitled "Evidence for alternate stable states in an Ecuadorian Andean Cloud Forest."  In this manuscript we undertake several goals and show several interesting ecological  

We further the field of Tropical Forest Ecology with our exploration of micro-watersheds as a very useful unit for spatial analyses of biodiversity. Additionally, as the title suggests, we explore the natural laboratory offered by Los Cedros - that of secondary forests  of different histories that are embedded in a matrix of old growth forest - and our observations suggest that novel forest types may be resulting when anthropogenic disturbance is severe. We discuss possible mechanisms for this.

The first was bring forward the long-unpublished results of Dr. Mariscal's extensive botanical surveys, which took place in 2005-2008. After the field and herbarium stages of the study, this data was archived as Los Cedros lacked the resources to finalize the project and writing. I discovered this data while working conducting other research at Los Cedros, and became convinced that its unique and valuable ecological stories needed to be brought to the world. 

The second objective was to bring attention to Los Cedros as a unique primary cloud forest reserve, situated in the Tropical Andean and Choco biodiversity hotspots. Those who have worked at Los Cedros know that it is one of the "last great places", but it remains relatively unknown by the general populace. We show with our diversity analysis that numerous new tree species likely remain to be documented there, 

It is has maintained its ancient forests due to its isolation and strict conservation policies, and we also sought here to document the success of Los Cedros as a 



In this study, we examine 


We hope that you will find this manuscript worthy of publication in Forests, which we feel is the most appropriate venue for our work in the wonderful Los Cedros Forest.
